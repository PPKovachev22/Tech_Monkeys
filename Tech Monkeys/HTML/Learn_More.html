    <p class="p1">Service robots are a perfect example of robots of the modern era. They are used in many hotels, restaurants, libraries, shops and other places. The advantages of these robots are that they are efficient, they save money and they are capable of doing repetitive tasks. In Japan there are a lot of hotels which are serviced only by robots.</p>

    <p class="p2">Industrial robots are a great example of the beginning of the robotic era in the early 20th century. These kinds of robots were used in manufacturing processes as way of perfoming repetitive tasks. An example for these robots is the robot Unimate which was introduced by George Devol and Joseph Engelber in 1961. </p>

    <p class="p3">In the future robots will have developed a lot which means that they will be capable of doing many more tasks than now. Also they will be able of making their work easier by finding the most easy way of doing their tasks. There are already alternatives to new robots which can do all of your housework and help you with other things. Tesla is one of the main industries that is into this new level of artificial intelligence.</p>
